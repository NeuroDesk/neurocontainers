The Atlas-based Processing Pipeline for functional and structural MRI data
(AIDAmri) was developed for automated processing of mouse brain MRI.
AIDAmri works with T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion weighted MRI or
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). The
Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas (ARA, CCF v3) is registered on each of
these MRI data sets and is used to analyse regions of interest. Furthermore,
the regions of the ARA are used as seed-points for the connectivity and
activity matrices. The lib User-defined ROIs and masks can be generated
separately and used for analysis, e.g. stroke lesion masks and peri-infarct
regions.
