  ----------------------------------
  ## bart/{{ context.version }} ##
  The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free and open-source image-reconstruction
  framework for Computational Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming library and a
  toolbox of command-line programs. The library provides common operations on multi-dimensional arrays,
  Fourier and wavelet transforms, as well as generic implementations of iterative optimization algorithms.
  The command-line tools provide direct access to basic operations on multi-dimensional arrays as well
  as efficient implementations of many calibration and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging
  and compressed sensing.

  Example:
  ```
  bart
  bart version
  bart bench
  ```
