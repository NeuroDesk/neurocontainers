## elastix/5.1.0 ##

a toolbox for rigid and nonrigid registration of images.

elastix is open source software, based on the well-known Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK). The software consists of a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to perform (medical) image registration: the task of finding a spatial transformation, mapping one image (the fixed image) to another (the moving image), by optimizing relevant image similarity metrics. The modular design of elastix allows the user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration methods for a specific application. A command-line interface enables automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of scripting. Nowadays elastix is accompanied by ITKElastix making it available in Python (on Pypi) and by SimpleElastix, making it available in languages like C++, Python, Java, R, Ruby, C# and Lua.
