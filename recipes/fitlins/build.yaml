  ## fitlins/{{ context.version }} ##

  FitLins is a tool for estimating linear models, defined by the BIDS
  Stats-Models specification proposal, to BIDS-formatted datasets.

  FitLins is developed against fMRIPrep-preprocessed datasets, but is intended
  to work with any dataset following the BIDS Derivatives draft specification.

  Example models can be found in examples/models in the main repository and
  FitLins Example Models in the documentation.

  This pipeline is developed by the Poldrack lab at Stanford University for use
  at the Center for Reproducible Neuroscience (CRN), as well as for open-source
  software distribution.

  Example:
  ```
  fitlins data/bids_root/ out/ participant \
  -d data/derivatives/fmriprep/ -w work/
  ```
