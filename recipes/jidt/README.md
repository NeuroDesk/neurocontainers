## jidt/1.6 ##

JIDT: Java Information Dynamics Toolkit for studying information-theoretic 
measures of computation in complex systems.

JIDT provides a stand-alone, open-source code Java implementation (also usable
in Matlab, Octave, Python, R, Julia and Clojure) of information-theoretic 
measures of distributed computation in complex systems: i.e. information 
storage, transfer and modification.

Examples can be found in `infodynamics-dist-1.6/demos`

More documentation can be found here: https://github.com/jlizier/jidt

To run applications outside of this container: ml jidt/1.6

Container includes python and rstudio. Other data analysis environments you 
may want to use, e.g. matlab, octave, julia, clojure are missing.
