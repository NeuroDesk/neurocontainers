  PALM \u2014 Permutation Analysis of Linear Models \u2014 is a tool that allows inference using permutation methods, offering a number of features not available in other analysis software. These features currently include:

  Ability to work with volumetric and surface-based formats, including facewise data, as well as with non-imaging data;
  A range of various regression and permutation strategies;
  Statistics that are robust to heteroscedasticity;
  Shuffling of sets of observations, to allow, for instance, the analysis of certain designs with repeated measurements, with no missing data;
  Shuffling of observations with complex, tree-like covariance structure (such as for the Human Connectome Project);
  Permutation with sign-flipping (wild bootstrap);
  Modified Non-Parametric Combination (NPC) for joint inference over multiple modalities, or multiple contrasts, or both together, with various combining functions available;
  Classical multivariate statistics (MANOVA, MANCOVA) for joint inference over multiple modalities, assessed through robust permutation methods, and also parametrically when such approximations exist;
  Correction over multiple contrasts, multiple modalities, for images with or without the same size or geometry, including non-imaging data, controlling the FWER or FDR;
  Various acceleration methods based on the test statistics and their distributions.
