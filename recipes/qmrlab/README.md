qMRLab is an open-source software for quantitative MR image analysis.

Our main goal is to provide the community with an intuitive tool for data fitting, plotting, simulation and protocol optimization for a myriad of different quantitative models.
The modularity of the qMRLab framework makes it easy to add any additional modules and we encourage everyone to contribute their favorite recipe for qMR!
