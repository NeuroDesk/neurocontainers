RadTract is a python implementation of radiomic tractometry or "Tractomics". It is designed for tract-specific microstructural analysis of the brainâ€™s white matter using diffusion MRI. It enhances traditional tractometry, which often misses valuable information due to its reliance on bare summary statistics and scalar values. RadTract incorporates radiomics, a method that analyzes a multitude of quantitative image features beyond visual perception, into tractometry. This integration allows for improved predictive modeling while maintaining the localization capability of tractometry.
