## segmentator/toolVersion ##
Segmentator is a free and open-source package for multi-dimensional data exploration and segmentation for 3D images. This application is mainly developed and tested using ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain data.

The goal is to provide a complementary tool to the already available brain tissue segmentation methods (to the best of our knowledge) in other software packages (FSL, CBS-Tools, ITK-SNAP, Freesurfer, SPM, Brainvoyager, etc.).

Example:
```
segmentator /path/to/file.nii.gz
```

To make the executables and scripts inside this container transparently available in the command line of environments where Neurocommand is installed: ml segmentator/toolVersion
